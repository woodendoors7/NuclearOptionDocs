#### This is the repository the wiki is being publicly stored, modified and deployed from. 

It is using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as the development/deployment tool, the wiki pages are stored as markdown files, and it is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Unless I will need to do otherwise, I am pre-rendering all pages, and not sending any javascript that would affect the page's usability to the frontend, therefore all usable parts of the pages should be fully static client-side.

I am spearheading this for now, if you'd like to contribute anything to the articles, message me on Discord (woodendoors7)
