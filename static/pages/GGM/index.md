The **Ground-to-Ground missile** is an optically guided anti-armor missile launched by ground vehicles to target and destroy enemy vehicles. 

### Details 
--- 

Just like the AGM missiles, it uses optical guidance to target destroy vehicles, with the difference of being launched from ground vehicles instead of in-the-air aircraft. Infantry fighting vehicles possess anti-armor missile launchers, which are used for launching this missile. 

Its effective range is 4km, therefore it has to be used from a relatively close distance compared to Air-to-Ground missiles with higher ranges.
